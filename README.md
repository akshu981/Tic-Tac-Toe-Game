# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
I created a Tic-Tac-Toe game as a final assignment of Programming II course in Java where the player can choose the level of difficulty, the number of cells (boxes), and if he or she wants to go first before the computer. The program displays the scores of the player, computer, and the number of ties along with replay and reset feature.
